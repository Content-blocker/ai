taught me great life lessons as well March by lanacastillo See all my reviews I'm from the Philippines 
For years I have always been curious about Indian cinema 
I've seen clips of Indian films on 
cable TV and to be honest
I just don't get it 
I don't get all the silly dancing and singing in almost all movies 
I find it so corny and irrelevant to the story 
But don't get me wrong Philippine movie 
back in the 's were also filled with corny singing and dancing 
But we have gone past those and transitioned into moviemaking based on 
good scripts
rather than cheesy story lines 
When a friend of mine recommended this movie 
I haven't really heard of it 
I thought it was a Hollywood release but it wasn't 
It was a Bollywood movie 
He said it was really funny so out of curiosity I got hold of a copy 
My first thought was that it was nothing but a silly story of guys doing slapstick comedy that I have all seen before 
When they started singing All iz well I told myself
I knew it 
Just what I thought 
But as the movie progressed
I was amazed at the intelligence embedded in this movie 
I was so impressed with the smart dialogues delivered by Amir Khan 
It was so mature and thoughtprovoking The life crisis all of them were in
the pressures at schoolthe pressures from society and the pressures from family as well
they rang so true 
I was even at one time crying my heart out 
I can't believe it 
All the preconceived notions about a Bollywood movie were obliterated 
I was so moved by this picture and I have no regrets seeing it

invested in the characters as it unfolds

Peter Bogdanovich Timothy Bottoms Jeff Bridges Cybill Shepherd Edit Storyline Set in the midwest of the depressionera Paper Moon follows Moses Pray and Addie Loggins one a con artist the other the young girl who's the daughter of a woman who's just passed away 
The pair meet when 'Mose' stops by the sparselyattended funeral in Kansas of a woman he once knew we never see her 
In attendance is the woman's young daughter Addie 
who 
Moses agrees to transport to St Joseph Mo for money of course 
Mose an inveterate hustler has been working ostensibly as a representative of the Kansas Bible Company who picks his marks from the obits and tries to sell at exorbitant prices the decedents' spouse the custom bible they'd previously ordered 
Wise beyond her years Addie picks up on Moses' grift and very quickly she and Mose become a team 
Traveling from town to town making money in every dishonest way imaginable and looking for the ultimate score

up front with her big tits February by DommyCommy See all my reviews Film directors of the 's had an obsession with older film 
of the 's and 's The director of this movie is Peter Bogdonavich and he really put together a masterpiece of nostalgic film making 
Paper Moon is a classic comedy drama that resembles the film 
of John Ford or Sam Wood 
Ryan O' Neal in his best performance 
stars as Moses pray a con man who sells bibles to recent widows meets up with Addie Loggins played by Academy Award Winner Tatum O'Neal who is wonderful 
The cinematography is beautifully crafted 
The landscapes and roads of St Louis and other cities are so expertly filmed 
The black and white photography would make todays audiences think this film was released in not years after in Now years later this film holds up and stands the test of time 
I don't want to give too much away 
I am sure many of the readers her 
have seen it 
The supporting cast is great John Hillerman in roles a bootlegger and his brother who is a sheriff 
Then you 
have Randy Quaid and Burton Gilliam in smaller roles 
Pj Johnson is hysterical as the maid to Miss Trixie Delight played with such zest by th greatest comic actress of the th century the late and great Madeline Kahn 
She stole the film 
She was nominated for an Oscar for supporting actress and lost out to you 
know who 
I think she should have gotten it 
because her role really was supporting and also for a small role around minute 
with few closeups she gave such a tarnished performance 
She makes you 
laugh so hard and yet is so heartbreakingly touching in her big scene on the hill with Addie 
If this film was actually made in the 's Moses could have been played by maybe James Stewart James Cagney Henry Fonda or John Garfied 
Addie could have been played by Shirley Temple and Trixie maybe have been played by Sylvia Sidney Betty Field or Ann Sheridan 
But I don't think they could have played them any better than Ryan O'Neal Tatum O'Neal and most especially Madeline Kahn

Aamir's CareerBest film July by isshvkv See all my reviews I give JJWS The victory of the underdog theme makes for great entertainment 
a true classic it has that Aamir stamp all over it 
This is a movie 
I've wanted to write about since ages 
I seriously think it 
one of the most understated movie 
of Hindi cinema 
It clearly hasn't received it 
due credit 
This is the story of a familyfamily of a father two young sonsabout the bond between themstory of a small town life 
JJWS is so real 
Life of a small town boy
who initially is Carefree funlovinggoes to the extent of causing a lot of trouble thru his actions BUT eventuallyhe takes a uturnturns a newleaf Decides to take revenge in a very specialway
he also starts respecting both his Father eversupportive Brother
I love that scene just before final cycle race 
where Sanju starts crying talks to Ratan feels bad that Ratan couldn't take part in the race because of Sanju's tussle with the villainous Rajputchamp
Victory at the end wiping out all his pastanticsJJWS is completeThe characters just live with you 
in daytoday lifeThe vision of the director is so fantasticand never has he had to sacrifice entertainment to fulfill itJJWS covers so many different aspects of a teenagers life and the movie 
has been so tastefully done that one can easily relate to the theme being portrayedI say this because I grew up watching JJWS and have seen it almost time 
and each of those time 
i have discovered some new aspect of the movie 
The attention to detail is immaculate and this is the hallmark of a good movie 
One of the most interesting aspects of JJWS is the background score 
Not for one moment do you 
feel that the music doesn't belong there and has been inserted there just for the heck of it as is the case with most of the movie 
of the time 
The training montagewhen Sanju prepares for the final cycle race 
the music when the race is going on the music when the Rajput boys go through MalRoad shouting Vir Bahadur Ladke Kaun
and for that matter every second of JJWS has remarkable music complementing the stellar performance 
The way the song 'Pehla Nasha' captures the feeling of your first crush cannot be described 
Jatin Lalit have really done a wonderful job 
Last but not the least the way human emotions have been portrayed in JJWS is beyond comparison 
I will never forget the scene in which SanjuAamir tells his father that Ratan has had an accident 
The acting by both the actors doesn't go overboard and there's no melodrama the scene finds it 
place among the best in my mindIn my opinion JJWS was way ahead of it 
time 
in Hindi cinema and has been denied it 
due credit as a result of internal politics in BollywoodWhat really makes JJWS compelling viewing is director Mansoor Khan's simple yet excellent narrative 
Most of the characters are etched out well 
Some great relationships are portrayed in the movie
The coldness between Sanju his dad is brought out in the movie 
pretty well 
Secondly between Sanju and his best friend Anjali who turns out to be his love eventually 
Sanju never sees the love Anjali has for him until she's the only support he has when he's alone in life 
Thirdly between the two brothers Ratan and Sanju
who are as dissimilar to each other as one can think of
but are still so close to each other 
One of the best sibling relationships portrayed in a Hindi movie 
Three cheers for Aamir who has defied his chocolateboy looks to emerge as the mostvaried actor of his time The biggest thing for the people in the town is the interschool sports competition held every year 
Ever since his cycling victory against the Rival school Rajput Ramlal has been obsessed with Model beating them through his obedient older son Ratan 
Model's model student in studies sports and character and the pride of his father 
there's one student who can win laurels for his school
the honest hardworking Ratan who's the gem of Model High School 
Ratan is determined to win this race this time
but courtesy a fight with Deepak Tijori and gang he falls from a cliff and is badly injured 
Model High's only hope
Ratan can't participate in the race now and Model has to be content with it 
usual pyjamachaap image 
Sanju is a happygolucky bloke who loves hanging with friends and having fun in life even if it causes him to fail classes and disappoint his father 
When this sudden tragedy occurs to Ratan 
Sanju is transformed from a guy with not a care in the world to a responsible friend brother son and athlete 
The stage is now set for a tale of friendshiplovefamilysports and competition told beautifully by Mansoor Khan 
All the performance 
are in top formAamir Khan is as adorable as ever as Sanju 
You can't help but love him in this sweet role 
Special mention should go to Mamik who plays Ratan 
He put in a very sincere performance 
you can't say that that was his first moviehe looked like a seasoned performer 
It is too bad he wasn't seen too much after JJWS 
Overall the movie 
was excellent 
Amazing story great performance 
and sweet music welldefined smalltown cinematographynice melodious songs
allgrgrippingcycleracescenes From start till end this movie 
keeps you 
glued to your seats 
Performance
a top notchAamir KhanMr perfectionist was totally remarkableHe is the soul of this filmFrom his starting nonserious attitude to ending maturing person was tremendous 
The bike race is symbolicespecially for Sanjay who finally reaches a level of maturity and realizes what needs to be done in order to prove for himself that he can do what needs to be done along with showing his family that he is capable of doing it 
His understanding of his brother matures during the movie 
This is a Must See if you 
enjoy Aamir Khan movie

EVER October by UrbanFilmCritic See all my reviews What makes this movie so incredible is that while it is indeed a movie about magician 
or illusionists it is also a complex character study about how self destructive obsessions are with a sideline love story and a scifi twist A unique plot with an amazing castany of whom could believably garner an Oscar nomination 
Christian Bale was amazing in one of his rare cockney performances 
We already know from 
Kate and Leopold how well Hugh Jackman plays a distinguished English gent 
He's absolutely priceless 
Is there any point in discussing Sir Michael Caine He brings polish to the movie 
This is the kind of flick that you 
can discuss for weeks after 
The plot is so detailed and complete and open to interpretation 
My friend and I have been discussing various nuances of this film for the past weeks 
It definitely stays with you

January by markthomassintek See all my reviews REVIEW UNDERWATER UK RELEASE DATE February Cloverfield Godzilla Alien The Abyiss 
The above films either were great had parts of them that were great or since being released have become just great films to watch 
Each building the suspence up in their own way and making you 
actually care what happens to the characters not to mention the stories unfortunately
Literally this film is a rip off from all of the above in one way that doesn't carry across the suspence and you 
certainly don't care what happens to any of the characters except one the little stuffed bunny 
It's such a shame really because this film could have done so much more but just didn't lazy writing 
Acting except for the stuffed bunny was acceptable but it just become boring towards the predictable end 
Certainly one to see if it's on TV
